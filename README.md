<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is the API for Zed, a file sharing platform I built for the Hashnode and Linode Hackathon.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ûïüåë

### Built with

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Running the server locally

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

- Clone this repo (have git installed)
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/lucky-chap/zed-sharing-node.git
  ```
- Install dependencies (have nodejs installed)
  ```sh
  cd zed-sharing-node
  yarn install # or npm install
  ```
- Make sure you create a `.env` file and fill it with `.env.example` as reference
- In [config.js](./config/config.js), remove the `dialectOptions` object as you would not be needing
  it in development
- Build, seed and migrate the database all together
  ```sh
  yarn build
  ```
- Now run the server
  ```sh
  yarn start
  ```

## Running the server in production

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

- Clone this repo (have git installed)
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/lucky-chap/zed-sharing-node.git
  ```
- Install dependencies (have nodejs installed)
  ```sh
  cd zed-sharing-node
  yarn install # or npm install
  ```
- Make sure you create a `.env` file and fill it with `.env.example` as reference
- Also remember to add an SSL certificate file to the `root` folder so `sequelize` can read from
  there. This is required to connect to the MySQL database on your server
- Build, seed and migrate the database all together
  ```sh
  yarn build
  ```
- Now run the server
  ```sh
  yarn start
  ```
